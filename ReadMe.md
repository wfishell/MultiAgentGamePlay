# Project Statement

We aim to build a tool that turns natural language descriptions of multi-agent systems into executable code. By leveraging large language models to convert language into precise LTL specifications and employing reactive synthesis techniques, we bridge the gap between conceptual design and system realization. This tool empowers users to observe, interact with, and control the dynamic behaviors of interconnected agents.

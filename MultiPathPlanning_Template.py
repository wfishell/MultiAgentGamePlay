Generic Multi-Agent Reactive Planning Template

This template abstracts a reactive synthesis problem where multiple agents must plan
paths subject to LTL constraints. The JSON specification is expected to use the following keys:
    "ltl_formulation", "System_Player", "Environment_Player", "Inputs", "Outputs"
Each constraint in the LTL formulation should be interpreted by the planner and integrated
into the planning specification.

The template is organized into two main parts:
1. Environment Setup  a generic grid environment (you can customize the layout and drawing).
2. Reactive Planning Manager a generalized version of the multi-agent planning loop.

  <h1>LLM to LTL formulation Pipeline</h1>
  
  <p>
    We pass in text descriptions of our games, with a high level description of the gameplay, system requirements, and liveness requirements. Using this information, the LLM outputs a JSON file with LTL formulation, system Player information, and environment player information. We then construct a parity game to check this LTL specification is realizable. If it is not, regenerate the LTL specification; otherwise, we continue to generate the game.

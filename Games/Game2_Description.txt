Warehouse Package Delivery Game:
In this game, the environment intermittently generates boxes at specific time steps, but new packages only appear once all current ones have been delivered. Robot agents continuously move across the grid, updating their positions at each time step. Each robot is assigned specific packages and can carry only one package at a time. When a robot picks up a package, its behavior switches from a navigating state to a carrying state. Delivered packages are dropped in the robot’s designated 4×4 zone, and once a package is dropped at a location, that cell becomes an obstacle that the robot must navigate around. Furthermore, once all packages assigned to a robot for a given time step are delivered, those boxes vanish from the robot’s zone. The environment never generates more than four boxes per robot zone at any time.

Safety Requirements: Robots must never share a grid cell and must plan moves to avoid collisions during simultaneous moves, must avoid both static obstacles (cells transformed by delivered packages, Cell Walls) and dynamic obstacles (other robots and undelivered boxes), may carry only one package at a time to ensure package integrity, must ensure that obstacles created by delivered packages do not block critical pathways to their designated delivery zones, and may only change states when properly positioned—with pickups limited to designated spawn points and drop-offs restricted to the assigned 4×4 delivery zone.

Liveness Requirements: Every robot must move to a new legal grid cell at each time step to ensure continuous movement and prevent deadlock, must eventually pick up and deliver its assigned packages—with new packages generated only after all previous ones are delivered, must continuously adapt routes as obstacles change, and once all packages for a given time step are delivered, the boxes in the delivery zone are removed to clear the zone for future deliveries.

At every time step, the game outputs the positions and states (navigating or carrying) of all robot agents, along with the current grid configuration that includes obstacles and package locations. This ongoing update provides continuous monitoring of both robot movements and the evolving warehouse environment.

In this Modified Strix game, up to four robots—each marked by a unique color—start on an unconquerable square matching their color. Robots continuously move to expand their territory by drawing streams from their existing areas, alternating between a safe zone state (inside their already conquered squares) and a conquering state. While conquering, if a robot has its stream intersected by another robot or intersects its own stream, its connection is broken and it reverts to its starting square, losing all territory it has gained; however, connections cannot be broken when a robot is in its own squares. Although robots may intrude into another robot’s unconquerable square, these areas remain unchanged and are never incorporated into the intruder’s territory. The objective is to conquer as much of the map as possible while maintaining constant movement and avoiding collisions with walls and other robots.

Safety Requirements: Robots must never collide with one another or the environment, and while they may enter another robot’s unconquerable square, those squares will never change color or be incorporated into their territory. Robots must only draw streams from their own conquered areas, and while in safe zones their connections remain secure from interruption.

Liveness Requirements: All robots must move to a new legal square at each time step, ensuring continuous movement and dynamic gameplay. Each robot must eventually leave its safe zone to attempt further territory expansion, with the game designed to always provide at least one legal move to maintain progress.
